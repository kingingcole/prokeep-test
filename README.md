This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

To make ssure all works, I recommend to run on Node v21.1.0, you can download and install that from the NodeJS website or if you have `nvm`, then run `nvm use` to switch to the recommended version in `.nvmrc`.
Then run the following startup command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To test, run:

```bash
npm run test
```
